# Sign_language_action_recognition(Major_Project)
Dumb people use hand signs to communicate, normal people have difficulty understanding their
language. Hence there is a need of the systems which recognizes the different signs and conveys the
information to the normal people.

We have taken google mediapipe holistic model to track our Hands,Finger,Face in 3D realtime

With help of mediapipe we have created our own Dataset of 21 signs and trained the dataset on LSTM model
